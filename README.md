# EchoSafe 🛡️

**Decentralized. Survivor-led. Encrypted by design.**

EchoSafe is a privacy-first trauma recovery and health journaling dApp built on [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) and IPFS. It empowers survivors to own their recovery data — encrypted, tamper-proof, and free from centralized control.

> “Because healing deserves privacy. And dignity shouldn’t depend on servers.”

## 💡 What is EchoSafe?

EchoSafe helps trauma survivors safely record their medical and emotional recovery journey through four integrated modules:

- **🔐 Medical Records Vault** – Securely store CT scans, prescriptions, or lab reports on IPFS, encrypted client-side (AES-256). Metadata is stored on-chain using CIP-25 — survivors keep the keys.
  
- **📝 Encrypted Mental Health Journal** – Track thoughts, moods, and milestones. All entries are encrypted before storage. Access is revocable, yet logs remain timestamped and verifiable.
  
- **🫂 Peer Support Forum** – Pseudonymous community space governed by smart contracts. No KYC. No surveillance. Moderation rules are enforced by survivor-led DAOs.
  
- **📱 Offline-first Mobile App** – Android-first for now, with low-bandwidth support and multilingual UI (English, Tigrigna, Luganda, Amharic).

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Millions of survivors worldwide — refugees, accident victims, people with PTSD — lack safe places to store sensitive recovery data. Paper gets lost. Centralized servers get hacked or censored. EchoSafe fixes that by giving users:

- Total data ownership
- Verifiable medical timelines
- Encrypted emotional journaling
- Decentralized access, even without stable internet

> EchoSafe proves Cardano can protect people — not just assets.
